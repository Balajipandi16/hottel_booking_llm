# Hotel Booking Analytics Implementation Report

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive analytics system for hotel booking data. The system consists of several components:

1. **Analytics Modules**: Python scripts for analyzing different aspects of hotel booking data
2. **API Layer**: FastAPI-based REST API for accessing analytics results
3. **QA System**: BERT-based question answering system with vector embeddings for semantic search

## Data Description

The analysis is based on the hotel bookings dataset (`hotel_bookings (1).csv`), which contains booking information for resort and city hotels. The dataset includes features such as:

- Booking status (canceled or not)
- Lead time
- Arrival date
- Stay duration
- Guest information
- Country of origin
- Market segment
- Distribution channel
- Room type information
- Average daily rate (ADR)
- Special requests

## Implementation Details

### Analytics Modules

#### 1. Geographical Distribution Analysis (`distribution.py`)

- Analyzes the geographical distribution of hotel bookings
- Identifies top countries by number of bookings
- Examines hotel type distribution by country
- Visualizes results using bar charts

#### 2. Cancellation Rate Analysis (`cancellation_rate.py`)

- Calculates overall cancellation rate
- Analyzes cancellation rates by hotel type
- Examines cancellation patterns by month
- Investigates cancellation rates by market segment
- Visualizes results using bar charts

#### 3. Booking Lead Time Analysis (`booking_lead_time.py`)

- Calculates basic statistics for booking lead time
- Analyzes lead time by hotel type
- Examines lead time by market segment
- Investigates correlation between lead time and cancellation rate
- Visualizes results using histograms and box plots

#### 4. Additional Analytics (`additional_analytics.py`)

- Analyzes stay duration
- Examines average daily rate (ADR)
- Investigates special requests
- Analyzes room assignment vs. reservation
- Visualizes results using various plot types

### API Layer

- Implemented using FastAPI
- Provides endpoints for accessing all analytics results
- Includes data summary endpoint
- Structured with proper error handling and documentation

### QA System

#### 1. Vector Embeddings (`vector_embeddings.py`)

- Implements semantic search using transformer-based embeddings
- Uses Weaviate for vector storage and retrieval
- Indexes hotel booking data with text representations
- Enables natural language queries on the dataset

#### 2. BERT QA (`bert_qa.py`)

- Implements question answering using BERT-based models
- Combines vector search for context retrieval
- Provides answers with confidence scores and sources
- Generates insights about the hotel booking data

## Key Findings

Based on the implemented analytics, several key findings about hotel bookings can be highlighted:

### Cancellation Patterns

- The dataset shows significant cancellation rates that vary by hotel type, month, and market segment
- Understanding these patterns can help hotels optimize their overbooking strategies

### Lead Time Analysis

- Lead time varies significantly across different market segments
- There appears to be a correlation between lead time and cancellation probability

### Stay Duration

- The average stay duration differs between resort and city hotels
- Weekend vs. weekday stay patterns provide insights into the type of travelers

### Room Assignment

- A notable percentage of bookings do not get the room type that was initially reserved
- This metric varies by hotel type and can impact customer satisfaction

## Usage Instructions

### Running Analytics Modules

Each analytics module can be run independently:

```python
python -m analytics.distribution
python -m analytics.cancellation_rate
python -m analytics.booking_lead_time
python -m analytics.additional_analytics
```

### Starting the API

```python
python -m api.app
```

The API will be available at http://localhost:8000 with documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs

### Using the QA System

```python
python -m qa_system.bert_qa
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Time Series Analysis**: Implement time series forecasting for booking demand
2. **Customer Segmentation**: Add clustering algorithms to identify customer segments
3. **Recommendation System**: Develop a system to recommend optimal pricing strategies
4. **Interactive Dashboard**: Create a web-based dashboard for exploring analytics results
5. **Advanced NLP**: Enhance the QA system with more sophisticated NLP techniques

## Conclusion

The implemented hotel booking analytics system provides valuable insights into booking patterns, cancellation behavior, and customer preferences. These insights can help hotels optimize their operations, pricing strategies, and customer service to improve profitability and guest satisfaction.

The combination of traditional analytics with modern NLP techniques creates a powerful tool for both structured analysis and natural language querying of the data.
